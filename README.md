This is years accumulation of useful functions for PHP.

There is very little OO here: it's mostly coded with a style somewhat like the PHP core.

Lots of functions for dealing with legacy script compatibility, wikis, RCS version control, convenience functions for http, html generation, xml handling (and site postprocessing)
