I woke up late this morning, went into the kitchen and found my bag of newly bought bread torn apart, with big chunks bitten off of the bread. God damn rats. Mice, whatever. I'm going to have a good talk with G. when he comes to collect the rent tonight. <br>Meanwhile, I stuffed the rest of the bread in the refridgerater, feeling slightly uneasy when I remembered eating bread from the other bag. Hopefully I won't get a terrible disease and die. Though I must say I'm more worried about getting a job. <br><br>If I don't get one now, it won't be for lack of trying. Yesterday I walked for miles, stopping at practically every cafe and store I could see and asking if they were hiring. I went through Glebe, Newtown, Broadway Shopping Centre, and of course parts of the city itself. And today, I emailed my resume to half a million employment agencies and advertised positions online. <br>I will do this, or die of exhaustion trying. So there!<br>And if I don't get a job within a week, I'm outta here. I'm not going to waste my time on a wild goose chase.

There are only two reasons I am staying in Sydney.<br>The first is Ying. Bright, lovely Ying who runs a cafe in the university, a place a feel safe in. Ying who asks me "what are you doing tonight?" and takes me out to dinner, movies, or just to hang out. <br>The second is my own stubborness and pride. I'm quite surprising myself, because I never knew I had so much of it. The thing is that I've already invested myself in the idea of living here for the remaining three and a half months in which I hold the working holiday visa. I've gotten a mobile phone, real accomedation, and gotten to know the city quite a bit (not to mention that I've spent a lot of money here already). I'd hate to see it go to waste. I'd hate to think I was staying here this long for nothing. And then there is also that need to prove myself. Giving up feels like admitting that I'm not good enough for the job, that I really AM stupid and childish and all those qualities in myself that I hate so much.<br>And yet, I know all this is illogical. I've made some friends in the place I live; two from England and one from Australia. One is a resident who's lived in Sydney all his life; he travelled around and then came back and is looking for casual work. The two from England went with the same working holiday program as I, and have been job searching for about as long as I have. None of them have found any luck yet, so I KNOW that it's not just my issue: it really IS incredibly hard to find work in Sydney. Wherever you go, whether it's the cruises or office work or supermarkets, the positions are all filled. I'm taking a course on Friday which will allow me to legally serve alcohol in Australia, but I have sneaking suspicions that I'm wasting my time and money. Is taking this course going to help me much in finding a job at a bar? I mean, it's not like they have employment connections. <br>Another option is, of course, to pack up and go fruit-picking in Queensland. I know this is better suited to me. Hard, physical labor that would strengthen me. Closer to nature. More contact with other travellers and more opportunities for adventure. This is what I am looking for, isn't it? But leaving Sydney feels like giving up, and I am too stubborn to give up. <br><br>So. Two choices. <br>One. I wait a couple weeks or a month, and see if I can get a job in Sydney. If I do, I'll feel better about investing in things like a mobile phone, and I'll be better paid as well. I'll also be close to lots of resources, such as traveller/backpacker centers. There are good reasons to stay here. On the other hand, if I -don't- get a job, then I will have wasted a lot of money on things like food and accommedation, and will be completely miserable the whole time.<br>Two. I go fruitpicking next week, while I still have a substantial amount of money saved up. I'll have my sense of adventure back, and I can visit my friends in Queensland, and will be paying less for food and accommedation as well (Sydney is a very expensive city to live in). The problems with this will be selling things like my suitcase and mobile, and getting my bond money back from my landlord (I have to let him know I'm leaving a week in advance). <br>If I wait too long, I could be "beating a dead horse", as it's said. It could be completely pointless, and I would waste money. On the other hand,  if I leave too soon, I would be passing up a lot of good chances, including friendship. <br><br>And for Gods sake, spending the whole day buried in the fourth Harry Potter book is not helping things. Reading is like an addiction now, but I know I'm only doing it so I don't have to make decisions. Procrastinating...<br><br>Shit, I don't know what to do now.

I'm getting used to the cockroaches, but I'm still sleeping with the light on. <br>"Doesn't light attract bugs?", said my mom when I called her up this morning. She had a point, but if they're there I want to SEE them, not feel them as they march to war over my delicate little body. Huh.<br>Well I got my hair chopped off this morning. It's now less than an inch long, and I actually look like I could be eighteen years old instead of twelve... but I'm not really used to it yet. I don't know what to think. <br><br>Job searching. I spend the day calling and emailing about jobs, sometimes walking into places when need be, but I don't feel like I'm doing enough. I'm not trying hard enough. The economy is slow and I have the feeling I could end up as a part-time waitress in a no-name restaurant even with the qualifications I have. Damn. I'm really, really worried about this.<br>But I have a plan.<br>If I don't succeed in finding a job in Sydney, I will pack up my bags and go to Queensland, where I will do fruit-picking work and visit the family I know in Toowoomba. Or I could do tourism work along the Great Barrier reef. I know. I have other options. But I really, really want to succeed HERE.... <br>Because it's hard.<br>If I can do this, I could do anything. I think...<br><br>Why did I start travelling anyway? I think it had something to do with looking for magic. But this is Reality, and I am a fish out of water.

Despite my lack of sleep last night, which was mainly due to cockroaches and nightmares about cockroaches, today turned out to be better than yesterday. I'm becoming obsessed with the idea of getting my hair cut. Somehow, I feel like I NEED A HAIRCUT NOW. I want it REALLY SHORT, I want to look like a little boy instead of a little girl. I'm just sick and tired of having in-between hair, and too impatient to grow it out for years. In fact, maybe I should buzz my head, or spike it and dye it pink and purple. There would go my chances of getting a proper job, though.... dammit...

My new place is filled with rats and cockroaches. I found this out when I went to grab something in the dark. Big huge fucking cockroaches. I've got a permanant case of the jitters now. <br>But what made me really jittery happened yesterday, as I walked down the path by Circular Quay in Sydney. There was a man there doing magic tricks, and a girl standing behind him with a whip.<br>"If anyone dares cross this path," he told her, "Give it to 'em!" Of course I stopped in my tracks and made my way to the other side of the path, hoping not to be seen. That was not the case. The Man turned his laser eyes on me, pointed, and ordered: "SIT!" I kept walking, slowly, wishing he would stop, but he repeated the order "Sit. Sit. SIT. SIT!" until, hesitantly, I sat. Eyes turned on me and I stared at the ground. The Man then ordered: "STAND!" Terrified and confused, I obeyed him. He ordered: "SIT!" and I sat. He ordered "STAND", and I.... very very very quietly burst into tears. I drew my knees to my chest and hid my face behind my hair, blinking and swallowing, while he repeated orders such as "FETCH" and "PLAY DEAD!", and suddenly I found I was shrinking. First I became a little girl. I know this because someone referred to me as such. But by then I wasn't even a little girl, but a midget, and I feared I would turn into a puddle. Luckily, though, The Man had turned his attentions elsewhere, and after suffering countless fathoms of embarrasment and shame, I found I had enough strength to stand up and walk away. <br>I got to a bench, farther away from the laughing crowd, and sat down. <br>"I can't take this," I said to myself. <br>"You are a little girl," I answered, "And this is too hard to get through." Another voice said: "Coward. You have failed." <br>"But not yet. I can hang on. One more day."<br>I used my free ticket and went on a cruise around the harbor, which was the best idea I could have had. Water is so soothing...<br><br>Today. Dragging groceries home from the store, a five minute walk. I had neglected to bring my backpack, so it took an hour and a half to get back to the house. I would stop every few meters, rubbing my hands. <br>"Eire," I told myself, "You are too stupid to survive in this kind of world." <br>"If I can make it across the street, I will be okay."<br>"This is pointless. What the hell do you want? What the hell are you trying to accomplish?" I really had no answer for that one.

That's what I mean. It's hard. Searching for a job, searching for an apartment, doing totally normal adult things. It's not dragging me down to the point of depression, which seems to happen to a lot of people, but I just wanted to admit that it's hard. Generally, I can do anything, and I'm sure I'll be able to do this, but this evening I am exhausted from walking around the city all day, and lonely, and I had a weird bittersweet dream last night that won't get itself out of my mind. So it's hard. And now I'm going out with Ying for dinner and a movie. I think I'll have a lime cocktail this time.<br>Drinking while unemployed! Sheesh, Eireann.

I enjoy being shaken up. I enjoy the kind of life where everything changes, where I never stay in one place too long and my state of mind is always different. That's another reason to go somewhere, anywhere. I enjoy the idea of being alone in a strange city, staring at flowers in a pond and wondering how I got there, and why I bought that ice cream. Even when I'm sick and lonely I enjoy it, in some ways. <br>Though for now, life is turning ordinary again. I am looking for a job and an apartment. I went out with a couple friends last night and had pizza and cocktails. I'm getting a mobile phone service today because the payphones suck. The "b" key on this computer doesn't work too well. <br>I don't feel at home around other backpackers. Besides the fact that they steal my food, I don't know how to relate to them in general. I don't want to be labeled and put in a group, even one as cool as "backpacker". I'm doing this for myself, because this is my life -- I am not doing this to be cool. I still feel kind of lonely, though I like being alone.

So. Here are your odds. You have arrived in a strange city halfway around the world from home. You are quite ill. You are terrified, although you don't care to admit it. You need to find a job and a place to live before you time -- and your money -- run out. And you don't have a vast supply of either. This is what I propose: First, do what you are doing right now. Have breakfast (and for goodness sakes make better choices next time! Bacon and eggs do not sit well with a weak stomach!), drink endless cups of tea and make lists. Second, go to a store and buy food and medicine. Unpack your things and do laundry, because your clothes smell like shit (or seaweed, which is about the same thing). Third, find a place to email friends and family from. You will need them. Walk around the city. Get a newspaper. Brush your hair. Never lose sight that this is an adventure, and adventures tend to come with unpredictablity and surprises. Your bad luck will pass. You will be fine. Now eat up so you will be strong and healthy enough to carry out this large order.<br><br>--<br><br>So that was today, my first day in Sydney, Australia. The place is huge! It's like New York. It has everything and everyone, and I feel quite small in it. I look at my reflection and wonder who that little girl is looking back at me. I have to Pretend To Be An Adult now.

My throat started hurting last night. I took cough drops and a glass of water to bed, and woke up completely sick. Five days before I leave for the other side of the globe! I couldn't believe my luck, or rather, lack of it. Luck of the Irish, my ass. <br>Took a shower, and some medicine, and made some tea. I ate some chips, as I figured they were the only food that wouldn't make me vomit up the DayQuil. Then, I sat down and listened to music, holding my teacup, and suddenly I knew I didn't have to stay sick through a two-day flight. I closed my eyes and imagined a bright yellow light around me, burning up all the viruses inside. The sun was coming through the window, and I felt warm. After the yellow light, I summoned up green light to wash the dead virus away and into the ground. <br>I opened my eyes. And almost fell off the chair.<br>No more sore throat!<br><br>Not, of course, that I don't think the medicine helped, but it's funny to think how little I believe in my body to heal itself without it. I tend to take medicine and suffer for a week or more, avoiding the world and immersing myself in books, my self-confidence in my body draining. And this time, I don't have that option. I HAVE to get better NOW. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. <br>New goals for this week, on top of the rest of the things I have to do: get enough sleep, take medicine, visualize healing, take warm baths, drink lots of water, slow down. <br><br>It's hard to see the lesson in all experiences, especially the mostly-negative ones I've had over the past couple weeks, but I will try my best.

Tonight I walked into a bouquet of flowers and goodbye hugs from work. A few hours later, as we were closing up shop, a drunk and desperate man down the street jumped from the roof of a shoe store. These two contrasting events have left me completely petrified.

Okay. Let's talk more about my insignifigance. You don't want to hear about this? Too fucking bad. Because this is a topic that interests me very, very much, and I'm not going to be putting it to rest just yet. Let me give a few examples of what I'm talking about here. <br><br>The cinema. I used to be overshadowed by my friend R., who was kind of the manager there and knew a lot about the computer and all, so when I started I'd sell candy and clean up. Occassionally, there would be times when I wanted to learn more, but with him convieniently there all the time, I didn't get the chance. After he left, however, I found that when I had to I could learn everything I needed to, and quickly. My boss grew to trust me with more things, and I liked the importance of being in charge. I could have been the manager myself if I had had more of a commitment to the place. Then L. stepped in, and he's a fucking genius. Again, I was completely overshadowed. With L. there, I'm back to selling candy and cleaning up, and whenever I try to assert myself and do more, they don't notice. It's always "I'll handle this" and "here, stick to the simple things", as if I'd never been able to do more than the simplest tasks. I remember one incident where someone needed their money back, and I was about to give it to them when my boss intervened and he said "Actually, we have to wait until our cashier comes back".... as if I'd never been a cashier! As if I couldn't even give refunds! On another occassion, these two girls came in wanting a job there, and I appealed to L. to convince the boss, because I knew he would be listened to and I wouldn't. God knows I've tried. And god knows I've worked hard enough to deserve it just as much as L. <br><br>Aikido. When class starts and no black belts have come in, Sensei asks the highest belt to lead the class in the exersizes. There have been quite a few times when I've been the highest belt, but he looks at me and then asks someone else to lead. Even when I've offered to lead the class, I never get the chance. Though I am highly respected there, I'm never put in a position to lead. <br><br>Coffeeshop. I'm treated more fairly there than anywhere else, but there is still one problem. I've been working there for almost four months, and I have never been put on "shift-leader" even though I've shown that I'm completely capable of it. <br><br>The little things add up. And though it's most prevailant in work, it shows up often in my personal life as well, and all around how people regard me. For once, for once, I would love to be trusted with important things. I would love to be needed as more than a menial worker or an errand runner. And why am I not? Why?? Is it because I'm small? Is it because I'm female? What am I lacking? Do I really have that much of a doormat mentality that I just let people run over me all the time? Well.... yes. A very few people tell me to assert myself, I know I don't do it enough. And it's not like I don't want to... and it's not that I can't... but there is just one, teeny tiny little fear factor to consider here: failure. The truth is that I have little more confidence in myself than most people do in me, and as long as I am filled with doubts about my abilities I will go nowhere. <br><br>Here we come to the chicken and the egg question. Which comes first? Do I become a confident, important person respected by other important and confident people and all my doubts fade away? Or will I have to conquer every single facet of my fear before I can be respected by anyone else? Problem: it takes a lifetime to conquer fear. Solution: wait for the next life. <br><br>So here we come to apathy, where the constant state of mind goes something like this: He can do anything better than me, so why bother trying to stand out? But I'd like to smash his perfect little face in so obviously I haven't accepted my position. And that's where I am now. Run over by other people, but not enough of a doormat to accept that it's supposed to be that way, so instead of a bland resignation inside of me, I have a slowly simmering but potentially  no, already  dangerous rage. And if no one listens when I speak, what do I do then? I resort to drastic measures. <br><br>Which leaves me with only a few choices. <br><br>1. I go from simply angry to psychotic and delusional and end up in a mental hospital for the rest of my life. <br>2. I accept that this is the way my life is supposed to be, and become another doormat of a woman who accepts any abuse that comes her way. <br>3. I do something important and heroic that catches everyone's attention and makes them think twice about me. Assuming I can actually focus and get it done without sabotaging myself in the process.

He is tall and handsome.<br>He is charming.<br>He is witty.<br>He has talent.<br>He can do everything at once. Fast, smooth, and correctly. <br>He is important.<br>He is loved by all. <br><br>And he rubs it in me at every turn. Maybe subconsciously, but noticably. It's the little things, the tiny specks of criticism flung at me good-naturedly. Jokingly. "You fucked up again". "Why didn't you pick up the trash?" "Here, I'll handle this." After a while, working with someone like that, you begin to think... why bother? My best isn't good enough, not paired up with this super-genius perfect guy. But I admire him, respect him, like him. It's not that he's a bad person, but his criticism is wearing me down. Sometimes I think I'm going to snap. Already, I end up crying every Saturday night because of his comments. I don't need that shit -- I can criticize myself ten times better than he can do it to me; when he sails in, it's too much to handle. But I don't speak up, oh no, because I can't win this fight. I don't know where to start, and I don't see anyone clambering to hear any word I say. <br><br>That's my problem.<br>I'm insignifigant.
