<P>you know when you are just about to go to bed and you hear something that seems so right, about how the world is, and you realize that the song was written 15 years ago. </P><P></P><P>I was 12. Genesis came out with an album called <b>Invisible Touch</b>, it was a smash hit, and it had a song, that always seemed to get me, <i>Land of Confusion</i>.</P><P></P><P>I had heard Genesis before, in fact I was somewhat of a fan, even when I was about 8 years old, and I heard the song <i>That's All</i>.</P><P></P><P>And I'm still into Genesis, so before bed tonight, I put a greatest hits album on, then heard <i>Land of Confusion</i> and decided to write a diary entry, because it says it all, everything I want to say, everything I feel about the state of the world lately.</P><P></P><P>So here it is....</P><P></P><P><b>Lyrics</b></P><P><b><i>Genesis - Land of Confusion</i></b></P><P><pre>
I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There burning into the night.

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion.

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

Ooh Superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour.

This is the time
This is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

I remember long ago -
Ooh when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago -

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep.

Too many men
There's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion.

Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for.

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to.
