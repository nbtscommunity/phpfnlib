And I can't even stay up all night... I've got my first day of ASL at city college tomorrow from 8 to 10 and then I'm working til 3:30. So staying up isn't an option... damnit.<br>I keep thinking this is not a once-in-a-lifetime thing. We are creating lives, all of us... They travel, I travel, we're going to see eachother a bunch in the next couple years. It's nice to think that. That this is just the beginning to a... ah... a beautiful new friendship. *giggle*<br><br>On the subject of new friendships, it's been so nice getting to know Carrie! Since before camp I've wanted to get to know her... barely talked at all at camp, and slightly more at Theory... and this is awesome. <i>Man</i> is she cool. Just like everyone told me she was. ;)<br><br>I am not going to spend all evening on the computer. Not tonight.

We even got some fun comments. This one girl walking by went "*cough*threesome..." And once this car full of college guys stopped at a stoplight right next to us and started yelling stuff... "Now that's a player! You go player! A'right!" and cracked us up so much...<br><br>Lots of fun.<br><br>And now I get off the computer. I hate computers.

And more than that I think all three of us feel really comfortable with eachother. Yeah.<br>They're trying to convince me to go to Waldron Island with them. After all, I'd only have to arrange replacements for 24 hours of work... and convince my parents to let me go... although that'd be more of a "I'm going now" sort of thing. And it'd be easy because I could just follow Rick and Carrie around... no bothersome planning things...<br>But I'm not going. Really, I'm not. No. <br>*sigh*<br><br>I feel very lucky right now. To have these two people here.<br>Even if they are leaving tomorrow.<br>I know I will see them again, for longer and longer amounts of time, as I get better at this traveling stuff...<br><br>I wish there was some kind of job you could just up and leave whenever you wanted. I suppose a job that didn't have anything to do with other people would be like that. Or maybe if you owned your own store or something... if it was very small.<br><br>Talking with Rick and Carrie have really helped me firm up my ideas of... well, college or not college, I guess. Ideas of what is possible in life. Reaffirming that it is possible just to <i>live</i>.<br>I really doubt that one. I really do.<br>If I'm not careful I'm so going to be trapped into a life I don't want.<br><br>Anything is possible, Marina. If you're willing to do what it takes, anything is possible.<br>I just don't want to hurt anyone...<br>In... a... year... or... two. Then I can leave.<br><br>I don't feel young with Rick and Carrie. Only very rarely, anyway. They're both two, three years older than me... With most of my other 18, 19, 20, 21 year old friends after a little while I start feeling very young. 16. Young.<br>Not with Rick and Carrie.<br><br>RickandCarrie. Heh. *grin*<br>They're awfully cute. I wish I had some film.<br><br>God I wish they could stay longer.<br>Like, a couple years...<br>Heh.

<td><div style="text-align:left"><font face="Arial" color="Black"><i><b>Travel plans</b></i></font><br> It looks like the easiest and cheapest thing to do would be to fly from LA to Edmonton for $374 with no connections. Of course, there is the problem of getting from San Luis Obispo, where I'm going to spend Christmas, to LA. Flying would be another $150+. If I go by train or bus then I'd have to take a taxi from that station to LAX and that'd make it almost as much money.<br><br>Granted, I will have enough money for anything I decide to do... <i>but</i> I do want to travel for 2-3 months this spring. And that will take lots and lots of money. And it'd be really nice if I had some left over, to move out or get a car or something adult like that...<br><br>I still want to drive with Nick et al. But that'd be so complicated... somehow get to Seattle, drive to Vancouver, take a train or bus to Edmonton... do the whole thing in reverse to get home... I feel ambivilent about wanting to do that, and if I feel ambivilent my parents almost definitely will too. :) I know they're not too sure about me driving with someone they've never met for long periods of time.<br><br>And then there's the fact that flying takes three hours and anything else takes days.<br><br>Sigh.<br><br>It'll get figured out.<br><br>Of course, if I want to fly I'd better buy tickets three months in advance. Which means... um. A couple weeks ago. Ah well. *grin* Strike that thought.<br>DUDE, that means it's less than three months til the party!!! <br><br>I am so happy with the amount of travel and getting-to-see people I've been doing. Seeing Kathleen almost once a week, going to Roya's house, Rick and Carrie coming <b>day after tomorrow</b>, Kathleen and Carolyn's halloween party the weekend after that, maybe going to Mel's party in November... Kathleen's for Christmas... New Years... my party... Emma, do you mind if I visit you this winter? January-Februaryish? ;) That is a major goal for me. Then big-time traveling this spring... and hopefully some more medium to long jaunts this summer...<br>But all that's very iffy.<br>One thing I know is that <i>this</i> month I'm seeing a heckuva lot of people.<br>Which makes me very, very happy. <br><br><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Current Mood:</b> <i><img width="25" src="http://img.livejournal.com/mood/roshi/palefaces/good.gif" height="25" vspace="1" align="ABSMIDDLE"> content</i></font><br><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Current Music:</b> <i>none. bah humbug.</i></font></div><div style="text-align:right">

Someone told me they have a crush on me tonight! I was just complaining to Becky about how no one has a crush on me this fall... and now this... reminding me how... well, how completely un-fun it is. Not that it's horrible, it's just... well, yeah. But my faith in the world is restored. ;)<br><br>I wrote out the longest email to Rick about how to navigate around Santa Barbara when he and Carrie get here (in FOUR DAYS) and my stupid@#%^#$&!#$computeremailprogram deleted it. And the sent-mail deal isn't working so I couldn't even find it... and like an idiot I didn't copy the thing first...<br>This feels like the worst thing that's happened to me in a long time.<br><br>Heh, that's cause everything else I've done to myself. ;)<br><br>Tomorrow I'm not going to come home.<br><br>I'm tired. And extreeeeemely greasy. Yucky hair. <br><br><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Current Mood:</b> <i>greasy</i></font><br><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Current Music:</b> <i>family watching "Chinatown"</i></font></div><div style="text-align:right">

NBTSCmail is down. Booother... That was my whole reason for getting online. But now I'm on IRC... and Ben and Neal love me. Aw. How cute.<br><br>Work was fun, as usual... got off two hours early cause we ran out of orange juice at the race we were at really fast. Josh wore the banana suit and played around on the playground and Elke and I took pictures... that was pretty fun...<br>I stayed downtown for a couple hours, read at Borders, walked to the library and there was this art fair thing which was cool... I couldn't decide whether to take the bus all the way to city college and go on the computers there or just come home, but I came home. And byebye unreasonable happiness...<br>It's such a beautiful day.<br><br>I'm tired, I don't want to move... I'm here, I'll stay.<br><br>But my email doesn't work.

I wrote lots of poems, and a song about pickles which I now remember none of the words too, and laughed like hyenas on nitrous oxide and went to a coffee shop and stayed up til 3 am giving Roya a head massage, two hours after she fell asleep... that was very very nice, I must say. I want people to fall asleep on my lap much, much more often. Hey, this is the second time Roya's fallen asleep on my lap. Cool.<br>And <i>damnit</i> I had to leave before her poetry reading. GRRRRRR I wanted to be there so much. I'm going to call her tomorrow I think... when I get home from work. <br>It was nice seeing Kristina too... I haven't seen her in... man, a year or so. Yeah, Kristina's cool. *grin* And has funny pictures of Daniel in makeup. Yup. Them funny teenagers.<br><br>The train ride home was something, too. Roya, 'member those cute boys you pointed out who were sitting in the seat in front of me? I wrote this about them:<br><ul>"Have you ever lived in a<br>tray-ler in Yoo-taw?" I hear laughter in his voice.<br>"Sure." And the conversation stops.<br>When I look at the boy<br>in the red hat his eyes are sparkling<br>his mouth open, empty of words.<br>The boy in the white hat<br>stares out the window<br>his words slurred as he<br>rests his jaw on his hand<br>and his hand on the window ledge.<br>We all watch the scenery roll by,<br>graffiti, green water in the large cement river--<br>"Too slow." "How <br>slow?" "Too slow." "Yeah."<br><br>Gorgeous boys, gorgeous eyes<br>under their baseball hats<br>Cardinal and L-O-S---<br><br>I stare a little too hard and<br>Cardinal turns around.<br>"Whatcha writing?"<br>"A poem about you."<br>It goes on from there, white hat blushes...<br>I ask what's written<br>on his hat and Cardinal answers "Lost."<br>I see it now, staring openly and I say<br>"Oo, that's deep, that's metaphoric"<br>and Cardinal says "Psychedelic."<br>While Lost blushes and doesn't<br>look me in the eye as he gets his backpack--<br>they're getting off at this stop--<br>Cardinal tells me they're in the military<br>and as they get up I can finally<br>see thier faces clearly<br>and suddenly they seem much older<br>and the train is emptier<br>when they are gone.</ul><br><br>So that was cool.<br><br>Then I noticed there was a cute guy behind me... He looked so much like Dan F it was scary! Except he looked more pixie-ish and he had bleached hair. Annnnnd... he drew my portrait!!! It's so fricken cool! He drew my portrait and the portrait of the girl across the isle from me (Monica) in pencil... and I really wanted to scan in the picture and use it in this entry but our scanner isn't working. Ah well, soon. It's a really awesome portrait too. Dana Peterson... lives in Lompoc. Yup. Coolness. *smilies*<br><br>I'm not going to let home get me down.<br><br>Jayzus, i'm getting up in a little more than eight hours. Must get ready for bed.
